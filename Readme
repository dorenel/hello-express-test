this project demonstrates connecting github actions with deployment
on aws. it deploys a simple http_server (which only returns "hello world")
to the aws and run a simple test automatically.

to see github actions:
    edit .github/workflows/npm-test.yml
    push the change to github
    see the automated steps under the "actions" tab

on aws:
    create a bucket
    make sure the bucket's permission -> object ownership -> ACLs enabled is checked
    make sure static web hosting is on if it's a static page
    generate secret aws keys:
        <your account> -> security credentials -> access keys
        create new access key and download them

on github:
    set the secret keys in the repository level instead of environment level
    <your repo> -> settings -> secrets -> actions -> new repository secrets
    add the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY with the keys from aws
    change the AWS_S3_BUCKET in main.yml to your s3 bucket name (just the name without arn:*)
